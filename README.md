# Serverless Classifier

In this project we implemented a serverless image classifier using OpenWhisk. The classifier is
accessible through a custom website where the user can upload an image that they want to be
classified. The website encodes the image and sends it to the serverless classifier. Once the image is
classified, the result is returned to the userâ€™s page and displayed there.

Consult the PDF files in the repository for further information.
